#Design Journal

For my third prototype, I wanted to explore more about terrains which we learned in class. I made a sort of a forest where you're a character who just wants to go on a peaceful walk. There's also added birds for sight seeing. My goal for this game was to give a peaceful feel after a long day. You can just walk around and explore the forest as you wish. I came into a bug with the water, I didn't really know how to manipulate it however I wanted to add it in to create a nicer effect.

#Assets used

- Terrains
- Conifers
- little birds
- Village Pack

#Questions for playtesters

1. Is the forest too spooky or it feels like you could go on a nice walk?
2. What could be added to make the experience better (since the game is mainly just walking)?
3. Is there any bugs?
