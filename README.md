# Design Journal

For my third prototype, I wanted to explore more about terrains which we learned in class. I made a sort of a forest where you're a character who just wants to go on a peaceful walk. There's also added birds for sight seeing. My goal for this game was to give a peaceful feel after a long day. You can just walk around and explore the forest as you wish. I came into a bug with the water, I didn't really know how to manipulate it however I wanted to add it in to create a nicer effect.
 
# Assets used

- Terrains
- Conifers
- little birds
- Village Pack

# Questions for playtesters

1. Is the forest too spooky or it feels like you could go on a nice walk?
2. What could be added to make the experience better (since the game is mainly just walking)?
3. Is there any bugs?

# Reflections

I achieved my goal of making the game more relaxing. However, I do want to make the game more engaging by adding more birds to find and also making the exploration less linear and a bit more over the place. But, I also want to keep in mind that I don't want to make the game too hard since I want to keep the relaxing vibe. I also need to fix a problem with the camera where you can't look up and down.
